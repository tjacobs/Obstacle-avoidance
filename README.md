# Obstacle avoidance
Building a neural network for avoiding obstacles on the Udacity self driving car simulator track.

## Requirements
I ran it on:

Keras 2.1.1

TensorFlow 1.4

## Train

To train detect_model.h5, run:

python train.py

The model.h5 is already trained to drive the track

## Run

Start the Term 1 Udacity self driving car simulator, and run:

python drive.py model.h5 data
